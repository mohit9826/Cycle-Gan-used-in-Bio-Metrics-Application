Generative adversarial networks are generative models which have
achieved great success in unsupervised learning in various fields including
image generation, image styling, in-painting and 3D object generation. My
aim through this project was to understand how generative adversarial
networks (GANs) work and implement the same to some bio-metrics
dataset of finger , plam and the techniques used to make it better. We
were trying to make a new type of model which can distinguish better pairs
of images of bio-metrics data of two different persons.
